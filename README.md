# The Arduino Fightstick
##### For CS 207 at The University of Regina

## Fightsticks for PC
- Inspiration for Project:
There are multiple quality fight sticks out there, from Etokki, Razer, Hori, and MadCatz, each one of these brands will run a person around $250 CAD. Which seems like an expense that could be avoided on an arcade fightstick you may not feel comfortable on. That's why I thought it would be best to create my own fight stick, one made just for me, by me.
It may seem like creating a whole arcade stick on your own is an impossible task, though through these resources, it was made relatively easy for myself, and possibly, for you!

  1. [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/insider/so-you-want-to-build-an-arcade-stick/) Has a beginner's guide to building an arcade stick!
  2. [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-FightStick/) Has a project by author JamesT107, which I found very useful.
  3. [DIY Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9NYNwv0HYk&t=2s) I found this project helpful in creating a sturdy wooden box that would last.



## STEPS
#### Step 1: Dependencies
- You are able to set up this device on any working computer that can run the Arduino program and has a USB port to connect to the Arduino itself.

#### Step 2: Materials
- For this project I wanted an eight button and one arcade stick. I purchased my buttons and joystick from [ParadiseArcadeStick](https://paradisearcadeshop.com/)
- For wood, I was lucky enough to have my own spare wood from previous projects to work from.
- Solder and a Soldering Irons can be purchased from your local tech shops, or can be purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/)
- The Arduino Uno which we used in class, can also be purchased [here!](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/)
- To connect the arduino to your computer you may need an extension cord such as this one [here!](https://www.newegg.com/black-startech-1-ft-usb-2-0/p/N82E16812200477)

## Programming the Arduino
For this part in the project, I directly searched and used the open source project called [UnoJoy](https://code.google.com/archive/p/unojoy/downloads).

I was able to navigate through the folder and found the example "BasicFightStick". Though it was not fully compatable with the design I wanted. This code is great if you plan on making a 6 button arcade stick, but needs a few extra lines to make it compatable with an 8 button arcade stick.
